# How to Set Distribution Method in Partner Dashboard

## The Issue
Shopify requires apps to have a distribution method configured before they can be installed.

## Solution: Set Distribution Method

### Step 1: Go to Your App Dashboard
1. Go to https://partners.shopify.com/
2. Click **"Apps"** → **"ShopInbtweenReports"**

### Step 2: Set Distribution Method
You should see a section that says:
- **"Distribution"** or **"Distribution method"**
- Or it might say **"Select distribution method"**

### Step 3: Choose Distribution Method

**For Development/Testing (Recommended):**
- Select **"Unlisted"** or **"Development"**
- This allows you to install it on your own stores without making it public
- No review process needed

**Options you might see:**
- **Unlisted** - Install on specific stores (best for development)
- **Development** - For testing (if available)
- **Public** - Public app store listing (requires review, not needed for dev)

### Step 4: Complete Setup
After selecting "Unlisted":
1. You may need to fill in some basic app details
2. Save the changes
3. The app should now be installable

## Where to Find It

Look for:
- **"Distribution"** section in the main app dashboard
- **"Versions"** tab → Your version → Distribution settings
- **"Settings"** → Distribution method

## After Setting Distribution Method

Once set to "Unlisted":
1. You can install on your development store
2. Try the install URL again:
   ```
   https://33d84ea52e46.ngrok-free.app/auth?shop=shopinbtweenproduction.myshopify.com
   ```

## Note
- "Unlisted" is perfect for development - no review needed
- You can change it later if you want to publish publicly
- This is a one-time setup per app
